            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><em>This easy pizza dough recipe is great for beginners and produces 2 soft and chewy homemade pizza crusts. Skip the pizza delivery because you only need 6 basic ingredients to begin!</em></p>
            <p>Pizza is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yeast:</strong> You only need 1 standard packet of yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons) to get the job done.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> 1 and 1/3 cups is the perfect amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in this recipe.</li>
                <li><strong>Oil:</strong> A couple Tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Salt:</strong> Salt adds necessary flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> 1 Tablespoon of sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough.</li>
                <li><strong>Cornmeal:</strong> Cornmeal isn’t in the dough, but it’s used to dust the pizza pan.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong> Mix the dough ingredients together by hand or use a hand-held or stand mixer. Do this in steps as described in the written recipe below.</li>
                <li><strong>Knead:</strong> Knead by hand or with your mixer. I like doing this by hand.</li>
                <li><strong>Rise:</strong> Place dough into a greased mixing bowl, cover tightly, and set aside to rise for about 90 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
                <li><strong>Punch and shape:</strong> Punch down risen dough to release air bubbles. Divide in 2. Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle. Cover and rest as you prep the pizza toppings.</li>
                <li><strong>Top it:</strong> Top with favorite pizza toppings.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake pizza at a very high temperature for only about 15 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
