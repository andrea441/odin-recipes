## Description
This project is a practice exercise to test and build competency in:
* Setting up a basic HTML boilerplate.
* Linking between pages using relative paths.
* Working with images and lists (ordered and unordered).
* Applying CSS for layout and styling.

The website features a main landing page that links to three delicious recipes:
1.  **Pizza**: A guide to making homemade pizza dough.
2.  **Ramen**: A quick and comforting ramen recipe.
3.  **Chilaquiles**: A traditional Mexican breakfast dish.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5**: Used for the structure of the webpage, including semantic tags, links, lists, and images.
* **CSS3**: Used for styling the website. Key concepts applied include:
    * **Box Model**: Managed margins, padding, and borders for a clean layout.
    * **Selectors**: Used class and element selectors to target specific components like cards and containers.
